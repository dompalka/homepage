          HOW DOES THE PUSH-PULL-LEGS ROUTINE WORK
        </h2>
        <p>
          The push/pull/legs split is essentially an upper/lower body split, but
          with two upper-body days to each leg day. But what makes it so
          special?
        </p>
        <p>
          By organizing the upper body with respect to the pushing and the
          pulling muscles, you're effectively stacking antagonist and agonist
          muscles with each other. So, for example, your biceps and triceps.
        </p>

          By organizing the upper body with respect to the pushing and the

          muscles with each other. So, for example, your biceps and triceps.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what if your split has you training your chest, shoulders, and
          triceps on different days? You're bound to run into issues when it
          comes to overtraining; not allowing your body enough time to recover
          and potentially leading to injuries down the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PPL routine circumvents that because you're always gassing out
          alternate agonists/antagonists. But what are these push, pull, and leg
          muscle groups that we speak of?
        </p>

            >The push workout is the chest, shoulders, and triceps.The pull day
            workout is the back, biceps, and rear delts.And the legs routine
            consists of training the hamstrings, quads, glutes, and
            calves.</strong

          THE BENEFITS OF THE PPL TRAINING PROGRAM
        </h2>
        <p>
          We've already touched on a number of the reasons why the PPL is a
          fantastic route to go when programming a workout regime. But, as we
          said, it all boils down to the gains.
        </p>
        <p>
          For one, you're always going to be getting enough time to recover.
          This might be more difficult if you're a beginner and you opt for the
          6-day PPL split, but it still gives you enough time to rest. And, as
          we all know, rest is insanely important. Letting our muscles recover
          is the whole reason they grow—not to mention all of the other
          psychological and physiological reasons you should be sleeping enough
          each night. This point really can't be overstated.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the rest time is compounded by the ability to properly load your
          muscles with this training split. Building muscle will never seem
          easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is partly due to the fact that these workouts usually contain a
          lot of compound lifts. And, for those who are unaware, compound lifts
          are the exercises that require you to engage at least two different
          major muscle groups. They tend to require some technique and attention
          to form as well; the bench press, deadlift, and squat are probably the
          best known.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compound exercises are more efficient when it comes to training since
          you're hitting several muscle groups at the same time. You can't get
          the same bang-for-your-buck payout with an isolation movement that
          works a single muscle at a time.

          CHOOSING A TRAINING FREQUENCY
        </h2>
        <p>
          Now that we've laid out all that on you, how do you go about choosing
          what's right for you? The first step comes down to how frequently
          you'll want to be working out
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a lot of discussion about whether 3 days a week is “enough”.
          There's evidence that shows that it's not, and also evidence that
          shows that it does indeed work for people. The central question is
          whether working out a muscle group once a week will provide enough
          tension to initiate any gains.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the more overloading the better is generally the way it goes, a
          beginner will definitely want to dip their toes in before diving into
          the 6-day deep end. Going too fast can risk injury and that'll put
          your training much further back than simply going 3 days a week.
